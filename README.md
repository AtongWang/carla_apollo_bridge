<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
This project aims to provide a data and control bridge for the communication between Carla and Apollo. It was tested with Carla 0.9.14 and the Apollo [master branch](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/commit/aa0c5eb66189b86a724206305712cfb337c07619) (newer than v7.0.0)

## Premium

If you want to delve deeper into using Apollo for simulation in Carla, you can refer to the following information.

We ([SYNKROTRON](https://synkrotron.ai/)) offer a range of advanced features, including:

### HIL cluster management

Supporting remote scheduling of VTD HIL, Dspace HIL, task management, data import and export, simulation logs, and simulation report retrieval.

### SIL simulation capability

Supporting perceptual algorithm testing, regulatory testing, and end-to-end testing of perceptual regulation. The algorithm supports Apollo/ROS/Simulink/C++ access.

### Scenario library management

Unified management of scene libraries, classification, grouping, and labeling of scene libraries, support for automatic push of scene libraries to HIL SIL simulation software for simulation testing.

### Sensor model management

Supporting the definition of sensor internal and external parameters for different vehicle models and versions, and supporting the deployment of sensor configurations for a certain vehicle model to the HIL SIL simulation platform.

### Scenario building

Supporting different departments and teams to build scenarios through UI and code, making it easy for testing departments to use.

### Analyze and evaluate

Supporting the testing department to uniformly write testing rules in the cloud for backup.

### Cloud simulation task creation

With the freedom to select scenarios and evaluation rules, sensor models, and tested objects (algorithm software or domain controllers) to initiate simulation tasks, and automatically send back test reports.

### Task management

Supporting different departments and teams to conduct simulation tasks, scenario building tasks, evaluation rule writing tasks, algorithm code submission tasks, etc. based on different business permissions.

If you wish to try it out, please contact us through one of the following methods.
